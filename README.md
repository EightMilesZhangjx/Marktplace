Thank you for your attention. I have thoroughly studied the course and have made an effort to understand it independently. While many issues remain, I have gained insight into the development details based on my previous experience.

Although my role will focus on operations, I intend to continue studying the technical aspects of the project. I am confident in my ability to perform the operational work well, as I have previously worked in Mexico for two years. While my English speaking and writing skills may not be perfect, ChatGPT can assist us in this regard. Ultimately, I believe that my operational ideas and experience will be more important than language proficiency.

ChatGPT helped me for the sentence, and I would like to follow my orginal ones so that you can estimate my english ablitiy:

I'll continue to study the technical part though I plan to do operation work, I can do the operation well as I worked at Mexico for two years, I can't speak very fluently and write professionally but ChatGPT can help us. The operation idea and experience will be more important.
